    /// <remarks>
    /// In the context of the input control system, input selectors are designed to control the
    /// circumstances under which an input handler should be activated, thus ensuring that explicit
    /// user input are directed to the appropriate handlers at the correct times. These entities are
    /// essential in systems where multiple, possibly conflicting, input handlers exist, each capable
    /// of processing different types of user inputs, but not all may be relevant or necessary at
    /// any given moment.
    ///
    /// All input selectors derive from the abstract base class <c>InputSelector<c/>. Such entities
    /// function by detecting when a specific set of runtime conditions have been met, at which point
    /// they will send an appropriate activation request signal to the input arbiter. Selectors may
    /// make determinations based on user inputs, such as via a radial selection menu, or rely on
    /// passive detection mechanisms, such as what the user is doing. Fundamentally, input selectors
    /// decide when any given input handler should move into the <c>Active<c/> state, which
    /// facilitates a seamless and (hopefully) intuitive way to transition between different
    /// interaction modes. 
    ///
    /// The architecture of input selectors is designed to interface closely with an input arbiter,
    /// which oversees the broader management of input handlers, including their activation,
    /// deactivation, and lifecycle management. When an input selector identifies the need to switch
    /// the active input handler, it communicates this requirement to the input arbiter through an
    /// activation signal (via a call to <c>ActivateInputProcessor<c/>). The arbiter then executes
    /// the necessary actions to transition control to the designated handler.
    ///
    /// The existence of input selectors within an interactive system is justified by the need for
    /// adaptability and context-sensitivity in user input processing. By enabling a flexible mapping
    /// between user actions and system responses, input selectors enhance the usability and
    /// accessibility of complex systems. They cater to varied interaction paradigms, ranging from
    /// direct manipulation interfaces to more abstract command input methods, ensuring that the
    /// system remains responsive to the user's current context and input modality.
    ///
    ///In summary, input selectors play a pivotal role in the architecture of interactive systems,
    /// providing a mechanism for dynamic input management that aligns with user expectations and
    /// system requirements. Their integration into the system's input control framework facilitates
    /// a more intuitive and efficient user interaction experience, essential for the effectiveness
    /// of modern interactive applications.
